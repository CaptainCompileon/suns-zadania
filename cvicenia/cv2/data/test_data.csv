Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type.

Dog,Bambi,12,Female,Medium,Medium,No,No,No,Minor Injury,1,0,2a8c1be3e6dd2577f62c8c5c33b3baa5,0,"Bambi was found in the middle of the road in Segambut in the evening (near KTM Segambut) and was pushed to the roadside by a kind man. At night, I went to the location to meet up with Geetha (the person who posted online in several animal rescue Facebook) to take the dog home first. We managed to get her into a cage by midnight - she was feisty and tried to bite us. She couldn't walk by then. The next morning, my bro and I took this dog to the vet and was told that the dog had broken spine that caused the hind legs to be unresponsive. We were told to put her down to avoid suffering. We didn't want to give up on her when she still tried to bite us whenever we touched her back. She still wanted to live. We took her to another vet and had scanned - she had dislocated spine, not broken, there was some nerves still as her toes did pull back when the vet pinched hard (really hard). She had lots of maggots, some were plucked by the 1st vet place, some by me (eee) and by the 2nd vet place. We used Magtox spray on her, applied med and cleaned the wound around the back of the neck. 2nd vet suspected her neck was chained or pulled with sth tight and the dislocated spine was from longer duration than the accident timing. Now her neck wound has healed with fur covering the area. Her hind legs are not moving mostly but when we pinch her toes, she would pull back her legs. Since June, she has been and is currently fostered at KL Pooch Rescue, Cheras to get swimming (once a week) and physiotherapy. I've been taking her to acupuncture sessions a few time per month to help with the pain and hopefully, she can walk soon. She is not easy to take care of. She will need love, patience and exercise for hind legs. She loves to shred papers and is ok with cats & dogs. Adopter to cover vaccination, dewormed and spaying.

Serious adopters please contact me. ***Priority will be given to those that want to adopt both. Thanks! :) 2 Fun, Affectionate Male Cats with Tons of Personality Seek a Good, Loving Home Good things come in two! Barney - Grey and White with Raccoon tail (10months) Chubby, cuddly, half-Persian cat. Extremely affectionate, loves attention. Will come when called and will automatically roll over to get his belly rubbed when you walk up to him. Will sometimes chase you when you run. Loves to eat, follow you around the house, sleep in cool/dark places (finds the best hiding place), wrestle and chase Hobbes. Also very paternal and loving with the little one, never fails to give him a good cleaning and a hug. And when he can’t find him, he’ll roam the house calling out for him (has the funniest meow). He’s a morning cat – will wake you up by snuggling his nose in your face. Hobbes – Orange and White(7months) Very curious, cheeky, active little kitten. He’s the adventurous, cunning one who will explore everything. You will be amazed at his zest for life. Has a handsome white tuft of fur under his chin, looks very regal when he sits. Loves plastic (sleeping on it, playing with it) and loves the sun (will snooze all day right in the beams of the sun). Absolutely loves balls of paper – can play for hours with one (not kidding). Finds the most random, funniest places to lay on – handbag, plastic bag, bowl, etc. Always jumps on Barney and starts wrestling him. He may be little but he’s got a lot of spark in him. Independent at times, but will always give in and seek the comfort of your lap. They’re both interesting cats with their own personalities and are extremely loving and gentle with humans. Have never scratched or bitten ever. No problem with strangers at all. Potty-trained. Very well-fed and healthy. It truly breaks my heart to part with them, but I have no choice as I’ll be moving out of the country. Please do consider adopting them as a pair as they really love each other. But if you have no choice either, you can choose to adopt one.

We took him in and found that he was dirty, having bad skin condition and emaciated. It was believed that he had been loitering on street for a long period. After sent him to vet clinic we found that he actually had microchip which showed the details of his 1st owner. His 1st owner told us that he've ""sold"" Jacker to one of his friend and after he contacted that friend who's the 2nd owner, he said Jacker actually ran out of the house and he don't want this dog anymore.(WE'RE EXTREMELY ANGRY WITH HIM). The 1st owner told us that they no longer have time to take care of pet and since then, Jacker stay with us and start his new life. Jacker's very very scared of human touch when we first found him. He kept trembling when we get near him and get frightened when you've big action. We're not sure what kind of bad experiences he went through but we're pretty sure that both of his ex-owner didn't treat him good! Jacker is a completely different boy now after staying with us for few months, he's happy, friendly with every dogs, loves to have pat on head, loves to run and walk around when he's happy, not aggressive to strangers anymore and the skin condition is fully recovered.

Although I'm not entirely sure about that, he acts like a blind cat and his eyes look like it is blind too. At first we thought it's just stuck together because he seems to have cold symptoms. then we noticed him running, climbing or moving around by completely depending on his nose and listening. This kitten has a calm temperament. He is a very gentle kitten and is not afraid of humans since he haven't seen how big we are. He climbs things and jumps too. He likes being pet and cleaned and purrs too. He recently learned to follow clucking sound we make with out tongue and follows. I am sad to see this kitten being outside and fear he might get hit by cars. He doesn't know how to avoid vehicles or anything big and moving fast. He will just get scared and sit at the same spot. Now he had started crossing the road from one side to the other depending completely on his nose and ears. I wish someone would be kind to adopt this blind but otherwise healthy kitten and care for his medical requirement. At least for his flu. Although the flu is not serious yet. Even a temporary foster parent will help a lot. He is the only kitten who has survived from the litter despite being blind.The chances for him to survive here is scarce, especially with the cars passing. Many kittens have been road-kills here. He has even survived being washed away in the drain and climbed out by himself. He's a strong willed cat and will definitely live if given the chances.

Or you can send e-mail. These two kittens are Beel and ToraRawr. They are kids of on of the stray cats we feed.We picked them up from the mom...she didn't leave them willingly but they were weaned. So I kidnapped 3 of the kittens kept them inside, gave them bath, fed them etc. The third kitten seemed too scared without the mom and seemed a bit fragile so I left them to them mom, and now a resident of the backyard alley. He seems to be happier outside. We decided to do that because we felt responsible as we feed the adult cats and many kittens we feed just die or disappear before even reaching adulthood being attacked by dogs and other territorial adult cats. Recently one of our precious indoor-outdoor kitten of 10 months went missing; very sad. We love the kittens very much and feel attached to them but unable to take care of them for a long time. They need lots and lots of love, care and time. SO for a better living condition and care we are giving our beloved kittens away for adoption. Kitten's Description :- I'm guessing these 2 kittens share different genes combination. Beel has medium body structure and hair length. More fluffier than Tora. Tora is the bigger species type with normal hair. Beel has a square shaped face and Tora has a longer face... 1. Beel : -Female -Tri colour Fur, fur slightly longer than Tora's. -Yellow/orange eyes -Enjoys playing with toys -Purrs when playing fighting with human hands. ToraRawr(Tora): -Male -Orange fur. -Yellow/orange eyes -Lap cat type. -Eats a lot.Will eat as long as you feed. That's bad. Don't fall for that eyes when he begs for food. -Quite vocal. Meows lot more than Beel. General : These cats will grow up to be quite big when fed well as parents are big and tall cats. Eye colour will lighten as they grow into adulthood. Please try to neuter/spay them to continue to maintain their tame nature. especially Tora as the stray male cats here start to get territorial and fight when grown up. But Tora seems very soft. So he might have been a loser if left outside with the other cats. Conditions to adopt :- 1) Both siblings Beel & Tora are to be adopted as Pair and not separated. One will go berserk without the other if they know the other is missing. They're close. 2) Not giving them away for students who live alone.A family is better. Only adopt if someone will be at home watching over them without being left alone too long. 3) Make them live a good life. :D",923a03e90,30.0,Adopted between 8-30 days,Selangor,Domestic Short Hair,,Black,Yellow,White,13

I guess she was stucked there for almost 2days or so coz after I freed her, she kinda stumble in her walk. Then I realized she's blind as there is no reaction in her eyes movement when my fingers go near her eyes and she walk without direction. I took her in hopefully to adopt her permanently but I am staying in condo. And about a week plus or so, I noticed that she can actually see because she was following my cats around. I thought its because she can hear them or smell them, but no its not. SUNNY IS NOT BLIND! That was a good news. And now she is super naughty and enjoys playing w the cats and eats w them. But she still need a proper place especially a landed property or garden she can run around. And she will bark and make noise one day and condo is not a place for her.

Second will be the kitten one Tabby white and orange like coloured, male. Third kitten is Tabby black and white coloured, male. Both kittens aged 2 months. Mother Cat and two kittens are lovable, very affectionate towards human. The two kittens are very playful, and very fun to be around with. All three are healthy, always kept indoor and all are toilet-trained. Reason to give for adoption is because I have too many cats already, and I have to put extra attention and care to one particular kitten which I bought not long time ago.With my busy schedule I will not be able to care for all the cats in my home as I have a very packed schedule these days,and also I live in an apartment. It will be much appreciated if someone could adopt them either all three together or each one of them. As I really could not care for them as much as I did before. They need new home immediately so they could have the love and care they deserve. To adopt all together or to adopt each one of these felines, will be a minimal fee of RM 30 each.

My friend never handled a dog before and though she was a little afraid, she has been feeding him and giving him water for the 2 days that he was there.

While trying to figure out what to do, a kind lady with her husband who had seen the dog before came back to help. In the end I managed to convince my mum for the dog to stay just overnight til the couple and I bring ""Bobby"" to the vet the next day coz it was already late evening.

Here is the summary of Lulu's life... Came to my residence few yrs ago. Often hides underneath drain due to the dog-haters here. When it rains, she'll still hide underneath despite rising water level. I had a dog & she does not like Lulu around. So I built her a make-shift shelter outside my house & feed her. A new neighbor moved in. I talked to them & they decided to take her & named her Lulu. For a time being, she had proper shelter & food. Recently, the wife is pregnant & they decided to throw Lulu away at a Malay village..! I was furious & scolded him. A friend helped to get Lulu a temporary place at a pet store (My Pet Centre, Setia Alam). The owner agreed not to charge me boarding fees as long as I pay for the dog food, vaccination & spaying costs. Although it was a burden on me, but I have paid all the costs. Lulu is now recovering from her spaying surgery this week. But owner of pet store wanted Lulu out before Hari Raya!! Time is ticking for Lulu.. She is a super friendly dog & does not bark excessively. She has the look of a long-hair Jack Russell terrier. Please help to share for possible adoption by any dog lovers, thank you all.",7a7277559,1.0,No adoption after 90 days,Selangor,Mixed Breed,Jack Russell Terrier,Brown,White,,203

This lady will take us and return us to the uncle after going to vet every week. Unfortunately, in between the duration, our brother, Woody got hit by a motorcycle and passed away, and we were very sad. This lady took us back and her friend is currently fostering us.

Very active and has good appetite (both table or dog food). She has been dewormed, no more flees (we managed to remove ticks from her some time ago with her shampoo). The dog is clean and no wound.

We are willing to have her adopted by a family who has always time to be with her. (most dogs are sad when they don't have companion).

He is a male and around 4 to 5-year-old. Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own?

Two weeks ago MPSJ dog catcher came over to catch stray dogs at my house area. One female dog got abandoned here few months ago and she has been here for so long. She stays at my street right in front of my neighbors house. The reason was my neighbors dog made her pregnant and since then she was there with 7 puppies, right in front of the husbands house. I love her but I cannot take her in coz I already have four. That day she almost got caught. So I told myself if she comes back safe from her hiding place I will rescue her. Praise The Lord that she came back safe that evening. I took her in and showered her. My neighbor told me that all her puppies are either dead or got caught. She is now vaccinated, spayed and dewormed. Blood test at the vet also showed healthy status. I need someone to adopt her. Or maybe if you can't adopt just help me to foster her till I find her a new home. I can't release her back on the street as I travel very often for work and I don't want her to be caught when I am not around. Please share this message to ppl you know who wants a dog too. She is very obedient coz I think she had an owner before. She is house trained. I kept her in my living room all this time to separate her from my existing dogs. She didn't destroy anything in my house and never pee and poop everywhere. She will howl when she needs to go toilet.",f45457bdc,1.0,No adoption after 90 days,Selangor,Mixed Breed,,Black,White,,113

She has been vaccinated, dewormed for the 1st round and given immune tabs to boost her immune as well. For the left eye, she was given a special kind of oilment to aid healing and also a maintenance to avoid any infection. She has been with me for about a month now. The eye doesn't bother her at all.

Dog,Guana,6,Female,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,3e0d7b850e104f5c7b9a09049f09af84,0,"I love Guana alot. Guana Description: 1) She is very active, she likes to run alot. So everyday I take her to a padang to run. Sometimes she might be hyperactive, jumping on you licking u nonstop etc. 2) She is very attach to People/ Owners. at the same time very playful with other dogs, can mingle well. 3) She will guard you door at night, barks at strangers walking past or walking close. In the morning sometimes she barks at passerby, but most of the day-time she sleeps. 4) Not yet very Obediant but very very trainable (with doggy Treats and Cane, depending on situation). She is trained not to bite shoes already (but sometimes she still flings it around for fun, but wont chew on it). 5) Can understand Simple words like: ""Guana~"", ""Sit/ Sitdown"", ""Hand/ Shakehand"", ""Come"", ""NO!"", ""Da Da Le!!""(Means Beat Beat in Chinese), 6) Will chase cats (Chase Only). Wont bite cats, will only surround/ trap it at a corner and bark at it non stop. Will stop kaciao-ing the cat if you yell ""Guana NOo!!"". The Reason she hate cats is once she got Clawed by a stray cat, at first she wants to make friends with it wagging her tail jumping around her, then CLAWW!!!. Now she hate them species.  The Reasons I am giving her up for adoption. 1) WORK- My working life has increase in activitivities, I have to go outstation or out of country alot more now (for days, weeks, coming project need to leave msia for a month :[ ). No more 9-5 job. Hiah. things Change so suddent. 2) Family- Suddently Parents decided to come back from overseas, and plan to stay in Msia for a long time. So means Garage park one more car= less space for guana to run. And they dont like Dogs, If I am not around they wont walk my dog. Most they did so far is fed her (very reluctantly) when I am not around. They are ok with her(wont hurt or scold her), but I know in their mind they see her as a burden. * What She needs now is Friends. Sometimes I can feel her loneliness. I feel sad. When she has a friend she can play many many hours with it and wont get tired. * Training her with tid bids and snacks are more effective than cane. Cane should only be use as a threatning gesture only. Only use it when she did something very wrong on purpose. * Maybe I am spoiling her too much. Hmmmm. * You can Change name if you like, as she is still young. some commands she still havent fully understand. Sometimes she dosent respond to her own name. * Feel free to take her feeding n drinking bowl, leash, collar and her remaining dog food. Let me know. If u want or dont want the things. * Hopefull I can find a genuine adopter before I leave on a short(9days) outstation trip on the 25th feb. But has to be adopted before 16th march before my taiwan (3weeks)business trip.  I Hope someone will understand my situation as there are so many unprecidented sudden changes in my life lately. I am Sorry to all that is reading this, because I could not continue taking care of her as my work will get even busier in the weeks to come. Hope a Genuine good adopter will take Guana in to their family (prefer people with dog(s) already, I dont want her to be lonely).",de97498e6,13.0,Adopted between 31-90 days,Selangor,Mixed Breed,,Brown,,,65

Then I was astonished when I saw this little fellow there and the driver was trying to avoid it. Since the traffic was heavy and my second lane was also at halt, I went out and try to pick the fellow up. Well for all you know God was kind and as the little fellow started crawling under the car, the driver moved slowly. Other cars that followed also slowed down to see what was happening.As I neared the fellow it ran to the side of the divider and to the pavement. Luckily for this divider there was a big piece of land (pavement). Seeing that he was safe for a moment, I went back to my car and drove slightly up as I was blocking the traffic. Luckily I was able to park my car near a taxi stand. I took some cat food which I always have with me in my car and headed back to the kitten. When it saw me it ran away into an exposed drain. Oh! dear I thought, every where was covered up except this part and in he went. I inched up to him slowly making sure I do not frighten him.I extended my cat food to him and luckily this poor fellow was very hungry. It came for the food and I slowly caught hold of him.

This picture of him was taken 2 months ago, and since then I have been trying to find him a home. But recently, when I went to check up on him, to my horror I found him limping with only 3 legs :(. A once healthy, boisterous dog is now disabled...according to the local residents, the dog was found with its paw cut off..I guess someone took him to the vet and got him fixed. They even have placed a bogus collar around his neck to make him look as if he belongs to someone..but he is still in danger, cause he is still out there straying....is there anyone willing to take in this sweet disabled dog? please contact me via telephone or email: usha. . Im trying to give this poor dog a better life. he is a very sweet dog. I will bear the cost for neutering.

Examples are his paws which are muscular and looks like a Rottweiler's paw. Onion is a good dog, he is like every other pet a family would need. Although there is the fact that he isn't really good with toddlers because he is considered medium in size and might accidentally push one over with his snout by sticking his nose in. He is nosy. He protects you from wild life harm like snakes, though remember after he does kill one, please throw it away asap as it could cause a bad stench or he might eat it, it never happened before but it could. Safety first. In conclusion, Onion is a great house pet, he needs space to venture and wonder as he is an agile dog, that requires exercise by running. He is "" okay "" for a family but not recommended for one that has toddlers unless fences are raised. He is also friendly to other people most of the time, but he still protects you from other wild beasts. We hope that Onion gets a good family so that he can protect and live a good life!

Faithful and I have always been pretty closed as if we have known each others for a long time. As if we are born to be bonded. In fact, our first meeting was just three weeks ago. Everytime we meet, she would wave her tail excitedly as if shes trying to tell me “Hi! I've missed you!” I often walk to the guardhouse looking for her and she would sprint towards me and keep licking my knee. Slowly, I've noticed I wasnt the only “chosen one” as she would literally do that to every passerby. 😒 Ms. Faithful is a little bit timid, but that doesn't change her love and friendliness towards people. Being that, she has developed good reputation among the neigborhood. Everyone loves her. HOWEVER, recently the other stray animals have troubled the neighborhood, leaving them no choice but to ask for the services from MPK. How can we leave such kind dog to be caught and put to sleep?!

He was just a tiny cuddly 2 month old pup then and absolutely irresistible. Even at that young age he showed his potential. He was well-behaved, toilet-trained, intelligent, and affectionate. Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information.

As all puppies do, she went through the chewing furniture stage, but has now passed that as her adult teeth have grown through nicely. She has the run of the house - and doesn't mind regular or air con rooms - she's happy in either. She likes to play fetch, and to chew on a nice 'treat' from the pet store. She can 'Sit', 'Stay' and if out walking 'Car coming' makes her sit down and wait for the car to pass. She gets these right about 90 percent of the time. She's fed on a mix of wet food and dry food - and certainly enjoys a few treats from time to time. I would hope that her future home would treat her in a similar way to the way I've brought her up so far, and not to be passed to a family who has the sole intention of chaining up a dog outside 24/7. I have to return to the UK very soon, and I really don't want to just throw her on the streets. If I can't find a home before I leave, then the only option I will have will be to destroy her. That's something I really don't want to do - so please - if you're looking for a well behaved, fairly housetrained fun dog, that also is happy to mix with other dogs, consider giving Lily Lulu a home. I don't want any money to cover any of the expenses I've incurred - but if anyone did want to make a donation to Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better - They would certainly welcome it. I would hope that whicever family took her, we could keep in touch, and if I could get back to Malaysia to see her again. She would come complete with bed, heartworm prevention medication for the next 5 months and a generous supply of dog food. If you'd consider giving Lily Lulu a home - please get in touch with me, and I'll happily bring her to meet you at your home anywhere in KL.",e911008b8,8.0,Adopted between 1-7 days,Selangor,Mixed Breed,,Golden,,,6

We recently took him home from the SPCA as an addition to our family but unfortunately, he's been clashing with our resident dog, Sunshine! They just do NOT get along, which is unfortunate as Norman is a great little dog on his own. Norman would be perfect in a one-dog household. He's loving, smart and LOVELY with kids. Very friendly with people and other dogs - except ours! Actually, our first dog is the one with the territorial issues. Norman is already neutered, housetrained and learning his commands quickly. He's a 2.5 year old schnauzer-poodle mix. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, I have also had my vet examine him (all at great expense) - he is in perfect health. I have also had him tested for heartworms - and he is negative and has been given a yearly heartworm vaccination. Please get in touch if you'd like to adopt him. I do not want to send him back to the SPCA if I can help it, but my family and Sunshine cannot put up with the dog-fights and chaos in our home (the dogs live indoors) for much longer. It's been 2 weeks since we brought him home and it's just not working out. I think Norman would be perfect for you if you don't already have a dog in your home. Though I do not think the fault lies entirely with Norman, our other dog was here first! Please sms me ONLY if you are serious and willing to take him on soon, and I will call you back.

Snowy is the mama cat. She has greyish black fur with a white undercoat. I don't know how else to describe it. She looks dark grey but if you brush her fur up its all white underneath.. She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter.

They were rescued at a month plus and currently being fostered by a kind lady who owns another couple of rescued dogs. They will make good guard dogs and their barks even made the fosterer's two grown dogs retreated a few steps. Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside. Her ears are the most unique pointy to the sides unlike her siblings and she loves any kind of food you serve her. Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings. To prevent more strays please neuter and spay your pups once they are six months old. FOR SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY. Please provide them with a loving home with minimal caging and adequate attention and care. A dog's loyalty is for life. An adoption fee of RM will be required for spaying and neutering to prevent them to have babies in future. We do not want those puppies to end up in street again.

The other is female - white coloured with black and ginger spots, also have a black and ginger tail.

Please someone be kind and give this little baby a proper, sweet home and she will be your true best friend until her last moments on Earth! All the best, Dino PS.

Dog,"Chamomile Clary, C'mie",5,Female,Medium,Short,Not Sure,Not Sure,No,Healthy,1,550,8be1c3bc298f4193effbe89eaf52e68d,0,"********** NEW Update ********** C’mie, the lost dog from Padang Merbok / Bukit Tunku is now available for adoption. My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter’s and c’mie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I’m pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I’m willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle.",6469a2a4a,5.0,Adopted between 8-30 days,Kuala Lumpur,German Shepherd Dog,Dachshund,Black,Brown,,17

BonBon was the only survivor from 5 siblings and was abandoned by her mother so I took her in. She used to be alone. I let her stay in my house with my other cats so she can have friend. She doesn’t mind being around with the adults and just be herself. She is playful, independent and sweet. Her energy level is high and she is very active. She doesn't really like to be cuddled. She likes to play rough. She doesn't meow a lot. She can get along with other cat; just give her time to adjust. She is suitable with a home with 1 or two adult cats. Younger kitten may be bullied by her because she is the baby in my house. Important : This is not an average pet, a cat who will sit on your lap, who love being petted and cuddled. I have her almost 2 months, and catching her to trim her claws or just to hold her still is an ordeal.But she really likes to play, all my cats will lose interest but she's the only one who still eye-balling the toys e.g feather teaser.She never comes to me and rubs herself just like my cats greet me. The only time she's interested to me is when it's feeding time or when no one wants to entertain or play with her. Sometimes she bites to get what she wants. I can give you some advice on how to handle her. If you want her to keep another cat company, she is perfect! And pretty low-maintenance,you can just give her food and water and that's it. Please give BonBon a loving home. With love, patience and affection from you, I'm sure she will be the most loving bouncy furkid you ever had. Please take note: Rm is imposed as a safe deposit which will be returned to the owner once the owners spay BonBon within 3 months.

Cat,Nobu & Yoshi,2,Male,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,2,0,0a0ab8c6be68d999ae909e71735bf6cd,0,"A couple weeks ago two kittens were found by my aunt's colleague in her car engine compartment. She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart.

My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. UPDATE: Pinky started eating Hill's prescription diet A/D yesterday (/09)through a syringe. He used the litter box for the first time by himself on /09.

We knew the possibility to find them back is slim as they were dognapped, not lost. After few months, we adopted a mongrel whom originally was our neighbour's dog. He was beaten every night until he became our dog. Few months back, we saw a lost&found picture of our huskies on facebook. They were dumped in Ampang, therefore we went and picked them back. It was a miracle, couldn't be more happy. When we brought them back, the huskies cannot get along with my mongrel, they were very tensed. Having no choice, both of them stay in my kitchen area as I don't have a big compound for them to run. I wish to seek for someone who can adopt both of my huskies together (1 male & 1 female), they has been very attached to each other all these year. No adoption fee is required, only requirement is for BOTH to stay together and adopter is required to spay and neuter them.

We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days.

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and Molly (female 3yr, spayed). As for Nova, he is 4 months old, male, not spay yet. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property.

I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old.

He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.",b857d5ac6,6.0,Adopted between 31-90 days,Selangor,Mixed Breed,,Brown,Cream,White,77

Dog,Two Lovable Female Doggies,24,Female,Large,Short,No,No,Yes,Healthy,2,0,8bdccd7204637fd93939a5ec4cfb0044,0,"This is a story about Clever, Hong Hong and Bobby. They grew up along Anggerik Aranda . They weren't abandoned by their parents. It's just that being canine, unlicensed ones, their parents were captured by MBSA two years ago. Since then, residents of have been taking care of them by feeding and sheltering them whenever possible. As they are females, they have all been neutered (at 9 months old) to ensure unsolicited attention from other male canines. Bobby (a female but named such), in human being's term, is like an autistic child. She was traumatised by her parents' abduction at an early age and is extremely afraid of human. She is very attached to Nike (the male Alsation, living in the first house, two doors away). It's extremely difficult to capture her, even MBSA has failed many times. Clever, as she was taken away from her mum at birth(someone adopted her and didn't want her after a few months) and was whining and pining for her for the initial few weeks..... she is pretty hyper, short fused and likes to chase cars.... and strangers.... so I am terribly if anyone here has been chased or barked by her. However, her bark is worse than her bite, just give her a shout and fierce look,she will run off....... She is a very good watch dog though..... and very obediently comes back to the house after she has done her share of running for the night. She doesn't eat much but more frequent than usual (three small portion), not choosy about her food and she's fine with water. She isn't the lovey dovey type though. As for Hong Hong, she is definitely the prima donna type. Loves to be cuddled, will know how to win back your heart after being naughty. She will look at you with her almond shaped eyes and lift her paws and rest them on you...... She's awfully afraid of thunder and will hide behind you or try to get into the house whenever it rains cats and dogs. She hates water and chooses food) For months now, i have kept Clever and Hong Hong in my house. Sometimes they do escaped but they will still head home for food. Bobby, she's outside, she has been taking care of herself. I just feed her dinner every evening. Actually, the three of them are part of a litter of 8. We have managed to get the rest adopted..... It is with a heavy heart that i have to put Clever and Hong Hong up for adoption. One of the main reasons is, my son and I are acute bronchitis sufferers and having dogs in our compound aren't helping with our condition. Secondly, i am having some muslim students coming to my house for classes next year and it is not convenient for the dogs to be around....... Hong Hong can be a really good companion dog and Clever, a good watch dog..... If you know of anyone who is looking for such dogs, please let me know.... my contact no is. Only serious inquiries will be entertained. Thank you very much for your kind attention. BTW, April, one of their siblings, is staying at one of the neighbour's house along too..... so actually is a doggy's lane..... most of us love dogs, and because of them, we are a closely knitted neighbourhood..... we know each other well and watch out for one another..... Hope adopting Hong Hong or Clever will bring such atmosphere to your neighbourhood too.... Cheers..... I am up by one now coz a neighbour who initially taken one of the female pups have decided not to keep the pups......",379d5e10d,1.0,No adoption after 90 days,Selangor,Mixed Breed,,Brown,,,154

They were rescued by Ariyanti Zainol (Mimi) from Bukit Beruntung when their mother died attacked by a dog.

All of them have beautiful, shiny black coat with soft, thick fur. They have no flea and are under milk feeding now.

They will be let go for RM 50 each. *RM 50 adoption fee would be paid to Cat Charity Club (CCC) for rescuing stray cats. *Another RM neutering / spaying deposit would be fully refundable once the surgery done.

Now the kitten is up for adoption as we dont have the capacity to take care of it and we don't really want to send it to a shelter because we know for sure a kitten at that age will not survive the shelter condition. Yet we dont have the space to keep a kitten of this age. We are suspecting the kitten to be a female about 3 weeks old. Obviously no medical record but the kitten appears to look healthy. We have been feeding it dry kitten kibbles soak in milk at home. It's still quite fiece but we suspect its due to the poor eye sight (due to young age). But once you hold the fella and stroke her, she will calm down. Of course situation doesnt really help also since we have another cat that kept hissing at her everytime she meows.

He had extra time and feeds from us and remarkably within a week, began blooming and catching up. He's still a midget today compared to his siblings! The most independent and inquisitive boy, he loves strokes and being shown around the house. He follows our feet everywhere! Loves sitting on our laps to watch things (whenever he chooses and not while he's busy playing, of course!). ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Louis must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email).

P/s : I recommend spaying/neutering Puma after the age of 2 years to avoid any health/growth abnormalities, which explains the pet being un-neutered. Conditions for adopting Puma: *Adopter must be attentive *RESPONSIBLE. Adopter should be willing to bare the expenses of future health probs (not just give up one day and leave/abandon the dog elsewhere) *Adopter must be caring, loving & thoughtful of their pet/pets *Like all dogs, Puma needs exercise so daily walks or plays during the week would be strongly necessary *Adopter must groom Puma occasionally *Adopter must be willing to vaccinate,de-worm & neuter Puma accordingly. *Adopter should be active in FB for the adopter to post photo's or updates about Puma to see how Puma is doing. *I may visit Puma un-occasionally at the adopter's place from time to time. *Adopter should bare in mind that once they adopt a pet, their responsibilities are forever so think well. I do not want Puma to end up abandoned in some place because the adopter can't be responsible enough.

I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ♥ Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ◘ Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc). This is for his long-term welfare. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Max-A-Million home, please drop me an email or text at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. :) Thank you!",3d136a793,8.0,Adopted between 31-90 days,Selangor,Domestic Short Hair,Tabby,Black,Gray,White,89

Massimo is very playful, strong and full of energy while Latte is more quiet and prefer to observe first. As my dad is moving over to stay with us and he has asthma, we are trying to locate a new home for Massimo and Latte by end of June, otherwise we will have no choice but send them to SPCA or PAWS. To all cat lovers, please help to give them a new home. We believe they will surely bring lots of joy and fun to you!",9c26f0fed,4.0,Adopted on the same day,Selangor,Domestic Medium Hair,Domestic Short Hair,Black,Brown,White,0

My foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time. Vaccinations and Neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Adopter must pay for the vaccinations and neutering. I am an INDOOR cat. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT.

I love snuggling up for cuddles and belly rubs. Canine buddies make me super happy, I really love to play! Like most of my ilk, I'm a clownish doofus ready to amuse you with my silly antics. I'm potty-trained on grass when outdoors and walk nicely on a leash. Please don't tie me up or confine me unnecessarily cos I will protest rather loudly and persistently. I have a major, MAJOR oral fixation and will chew anything and everything I can get my pearly white chompers on so I hope you'll be patient with me, pretty please? Other than my penchant for destruction (my nanny calls me T-Rex, teehee!) I'm a lovely boy who'd really like a permanent home to call my own. Please drop my nanny a message and make my day!"" To summarise, my nanny says: I'm ideal for homes that... - have the time and patience to train and supervise a chew-happy pup - have one or more friendly and playful dogs to keep my jolly self company - have a decent-sized chew-proof area to contain me when unsupervised - have humans that can provide me with lots of companionship - elderly folks, work-at-home folks, kids etc. and I'll be a happy chappy! I'm NOT ideal for homes that... - cannot tolerate destructive chewing. - leave me alone for long hours. You won't like what I get up to when bored! - have small, reactive dogs or other small animals. I sometimes get overexcited during play and go into prey mode - I'd prefer to avoid hurting little creatures please :) ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost. 4.

I'm a 4-year old female Pinscher crossbreed, and I'm lucky to be alive. Earlier this year, I was captured by DBKL officers and put in the dog pound. I was scheduled to be euthanized, until me and 60 other dogs were rescued by a local animal welfare association. Our story even made it into the newspapers :-) Nobody knows my past before that, but everyone says I used to have a master because I know how to sit on command! After I got rescued, a couple from Bandar Utama tried taking me into their home. I love them and I love my new home, but I can't get along with their siberian husky. The couple has been trying for months to socialize me, but it's not working and they're forced to keep me separated most of the time from them and the husky. Everyone's best guess is that I got bullied while I was in the dog pound, so I just can't share a space with other dogs. The couple says it's unfair for me to spend so much time in isolation, so they need to find me a new forever home. I love people and kids. I love to chase my ball. I'm not fussy with my food. I'm vaccinated but not neutered. I'll lie on my belly for hours and let you tickle me. I'm happy to stay outside. And I'll guard your house with my life and bark whenever a stranger shows up. All I ask for in return is your unconditional love, and that I be kept in a one-dog household. Would you like to be friends? Take me home maybe?

I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

It was directly at the back of our home, over a high wall near a neighbouring clubhouse’s tennis courts. We got into the car, ready with food, carrier, gloves and a cloth. Once we got into the grounds, with the help of the security guard on duty, we found in a drain that led to nowhere this teeny tiny puppy, crying pitifully with its last breaths. We caught a hold of her (no resistance was given) and brought her home. After a reviving drink of warm goat’s milk, little Roxanne was all wagging tail, snuggling her way into our laps and licking our hands in gratitude and instant love. She was de-fleadand was given a warm bed, and all she did for two days was eat, wag her tail, snuggle up and sleep. We were unsure if she would make it.

Cat,Sandy,7,Female,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,0f88833cac0568b2ffe27b3db771ae00,0,"Hi everyone! Here is Sandy! She is a 6/7 months old female cat. We found the poor thing on the 1st of January in our garage. She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far.

In Penang A lot of people will think that female dogs will dirty the place or cause male dogs to come when they have period. In actual fact, once the female dogs are spayed, they will not have period any more(The spaying cost is not expensive if you go for government vet). Moreover, my experience is female dogs are easier to be trained for toileting. The conditions for adoption are: 1. Deworm and vaccinate it immediately after you adopt it. 2. Spay it when it's more than 6 months old if you do not want to see abandoned puppies. 3.

Scratches just feel like feathers falling on you. She's currently being fed soft food and milk. She has already been taken to the vet and taken her medicine but we will take her to the vet on the 12th of June again to be absolutely sure she is worm-free. I don't know for how long my cousin can keep her :/ hoping to find a loving owner for her as soon as possible.

At least one puppy was crushed to death instantly. Another fom shock & truma after its tiny limb was crushed to bits too. All are very young around 6 weeks of age.Some have stumpy tails others are long. One is cream in colour, another brown, some black & tan and the rest white with brown markings. All were infested with worms but they are cleared now AND has started putting on weigh & becomes lively as the food ate are all utilize by their very own little bodies & not goppled by nasty worms as before. They are very active and playful now & ""quarrel "" over heirarchy. They are most delightful when all are yapping away in that lovely puppy voices of theirs. 2 others joined in on the 30 Sept.The small one with bunny tail & one eye patch together with another baby whose tail was tied with rubber band ( Cruel people tried docking its tail. It didn't dropped but turned infected with sore & maggots worms !) have gone home to a granny in Seremban on 4 Sept.The other of these 2 is an Alpha.He is just 6 weeks old but he refused to stay in cages or playpen & must run with the big boys.And that he indded does & we called him Morgan. There is another smart Alexis. She Is VERY SMART. Only 6 weeks old but learned she has GREAT magical power by pushing her snout between the playpen bars & pushed. ""By Golly., I can push this fences "". She pushes the pent to & fro to the delights of her fellow buddies this way daily. Quite a sight to behold. Come, these bunch of survivors from the construction site are some characters like their human kind. Thank God, they haven't acquire their language though. 8/9/09 Latest on our Alpha 6 wks old MORGAN Yes. 6 wks old Morgan climbed into our shallow watering bowl & stood in it to cool himself down. He immerse his tiny head into the water next & swings it about before pulling his head out.He shakes the water off next. Only then, will he climds out of the tub. My goodness, he is only 6 wks old. What will he do next ? He actually tried to steal sonme of Loke's ( ahigh ranking adult male )dinner tonight. Loke snarled aggressively & pretended to nap him ;only then did he scrurried away with a scream. Never ever have I seen such alphaness in such a tiny pup before. It is must be the construction environmental factor that spured such genes. 15/9/09 4 more 1mth+ Sunways joined us on the 9/9/09.Small little bunnies they are.

She bonds very well with adults and children alike, and is more likely to bond one-on-one than in groups. Jo tends to be more on the timid side, but once she is familiar with someone (which does not take long), she adapts very well with the environment. She is still very young, so her personality may change. Thus far Jo's settled in well to her foster homes, where she gets along with other pups and animals in the home. Josephine is still very young, thus needs a lot of attention. She does not like being left alone and does tend to follow you around or yelp quite a bit when left on her own, which can be a problem at night. She should grow out of this phase soon, and although it's a difficult phase, this is the best time to bond and form a solid attachment with her. We would love to keep Josephine but our apartment does not allow for pets, and it is far too small a space for her size.
